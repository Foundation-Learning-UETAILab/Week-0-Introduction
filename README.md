# Week 0: Introduction

## General announcement
Welcome ðŸ‘‹ to the foundation Machine Learning and Deep Learning course for intermediate learner offered by **UET-AILab**.

## About this Course
Machine learning is the science of getting computers to act without being explicitly programmed. In recent years, deep learning revolution has brought us automated self-driving cars, effective web search, fluent conversation agent like Siri, Alexa or Google.

This courses will prepare for you from foundamental knowledge such as probability, matrix operator to intermediate knowledge like convolutional neural network (CNN), recurrent neural network (RNN), etc. In addition, this github organization was modified in order to provide best practices in machine learning/deep learning algorithm and community for learner to share ides, issue or help request to others. After this course, you'll ready to dive deeper in computer vision, nature language processing, robotic, audio, and other advanced areas in deep learning.
