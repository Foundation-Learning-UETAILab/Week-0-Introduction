# Week 0: Introduction

## General announcement

Welcome ðŸ‘‹ to the foundation Machine Learning and Deep Learning course for intermediate learner offered by **UET-AILab**.

## About this Course

Machine learning is the science of getting computers to act without being explicitly programmed. In recent years, deep learning revolution has brought us automated self-driving cars, effective web search, fluent conversation agent like Siri, Alexa or Google.

This courses will prepare for you from foundamental knowledge such as probability, matrix operator to intermediate knowledge like convolutional neural network (CNN), recurrent neural network (RNN), etc. In addition, this github organization was modified in order to provide best practices in machine learning/deep learning algorithm and community for learner to share ides, issue or help request to others. After this course, you'll ready to dive deeper in computer vision, nature language processing, robotic, audio, and other advanced areas in deep learning.

## Week assignment

This week practise is focused on introducing several core technologies used for testing and debugging in future modules, and also includes some basic mathematical foundations.

All starter code is available in `./src` directory . Before starting this assignment, make sure to set up your workspace following Setup, and read Contributing to understand how the code should be organized.

Each module has a set of Guides to help with the tasks. We recommend working through the assignment and utilizing the Guides suggested for each task.

## How to use this course

Every lecture/week assignment is designed as a Github repository where you can submit your code and check whethere your assignment is working or not right in the Github pages.

Learner are not allowed to copy other assignments.

To start submissing your assignment, do:
- **Fork** lecture repository
- Create a new **branch** (suggest named: `your_github_name_submission`)
- Submit your work into this new branch
- Create **Pull request** from your fork repo to the base repo

ðŸ’¡ You might want to check your `pull request` frequently when you're submitting your work. A github workflow have been designed to automated check your assignment.

ðŸ’¡ When submitting to this course, in order to mimix the experiment in real world project, we setup some rules contributor must follow. Please consider to check it out at [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/Foundation-Learning-UETAILab/Week-0-Introduction/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) guide.


## Community

In this course, each week assignment have a Discussions work as a forums for learner to raise question or request help. 

Please introducing yourself and leaving a warm welcome to other learners at the week [DISCUSSIONS](https://github.com/Foundation-Learning-UETAILab/Week-0-Introduction/discussions).


## Contribute
We are still in the progress of building more tasks and practises for the course. So we are welcome for greate contribution from other like you to help we to submit new task.

Read our [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/Foundation-Learning-UETAILab/Week-0-Introduction/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#for-contributor) guidelines to get help becoming a contributor!
